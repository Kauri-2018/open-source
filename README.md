# Open source day

This is an important day for us in the bootcamp. As developers we use a _lot_ of tools, libraries, and even our operating system that have been built by other developers. Not only have these been provided to us for free but with the ability to change them to suit our specific needs. As users and consumers of open source software who are capable of contributing back, it's important we do. It's also extremely gratifying to know you're adding value to other developers, which has a multiplier effect on the personal impact you're making.

In addition to the ethical justification, there are significant learning objectives to contributing to open source.

* Forcing you to understand existing code bases
* Having to adhere to an existing style guide
* Understanding the bug and getting clarification on the fix
* The excitement of having your contributions accepted
* The joy of giving back

## Other ideas

* Think about a recent change in the community that will effect a lot of projects. For example, at the time of this edit, these just happened:
  - `react-router` was just updated from v3 to v4.
  - `React.propTypes` is no longer recommended. Now you should be using the npm `prop-types` package.
